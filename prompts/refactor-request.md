# Refactor Request Prompt

Use this to improve existing code.

---

## The Prompt

```
Refactor this code to be more [GOAL]:

[PASTE CODE]

Goals:
- [GOAL 1 - e.g., More readable]
- [GOAL 2 - e.g., Better performance]
- [GOAL 3 - e.g., Easier to test]

Constraints:
- [CONSTRAINT - e.g., Keep the same API]
- [CONSTRAINT - e.g., Don't add dependencies]

Explain the changes you make and why.
```

---

## Clean Up Messy Code

```
Clean up this code. It works but it's messy:

[PASTE CODE]

Make it:
- More readable
- Better organized
- Following best practices

Keep the same functionality. Explain your changes.
```

---

## Improve Performance

```
This code is slow. Optimize it:

[PASTE CODE]

Current performance: [DESCRIBE - e.g., Takes 5 seconds]
Target: [GOAL - e.g., Under 500ms]

Explain the optimizations and expected improvements.
```

---

## Extract Reusable Code

```
I'm repeating this pattern in multiple places:

[PASTE REPEATED CODE]

Create a reusable [function/component/hook] that I can use instead.

Show me:
1. The extracted code
2. How to use it
3. Before/after comparison
```

---

## Add TypeScript Types

```
Add TypeScript types to this JavaScript code:

[PASTE JS CODE]

Requirements:
- Strict types (no `any`)
- Interface for objects
- Proper function signatures
- Export types for reuse
```

---

## Split Large File

```
This file is too large. Help me split it:

[PASTE FILE OR DESCRIBE STRUCTURE]

Current: [X] lines, [Y] functions/components

Suggest how to split it into smaller, focused modules.
Show the new file structure and how imports would work.
```

---

## Modernize Legacy Code

```
Update this code to use modern patterns:

[PASTE CODE]

Current: [OLD PATTERN - e.g., class components, callbacks]
Target: [NEW PATTERN - e.g., functional components, async/await]

Keep the same functionality. Show before/after.
```

---

## Add Error Handling

```
Add proper error handling to this code:

[PASTE CODE]

Include:
- Try/catch where appropriate
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks
```

---

## Make Testable

```
Refactor this code to be more testable:

[PASTE CODE]

Current issues:
- [ISSUE - e.g., Hard-coded dependencies]
- [ISSUE - e.g., Side effects mixed with logic]

Make it easy to unit test. Show example tests.
```

## Tips

- Be specific about your goals
- Mention constraints (don't break existing API)
- Ask for explanations to learn
- Review changes before accepting
- Test after refactoring
