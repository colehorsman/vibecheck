## Step-by-Step: Your First Build

### 1. Go to Lovable

Open [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) and sign up.

### 2. Describe Your App

In the chat, type something like:

```
Build me a personal portfolio website with:
- A hero section with my name and title
- An about section
- A projects section with 3 cards
- A contact form
- Dark mode toggle
- Modern, clean design
```

### 3. Watch It Build

Lovable will generate your app. This takes 30-60 seconds.

### 4. Preview and Iterate

Click "Preview" to see your app. Then ask for changes:

```
Make the hero section taller
Change the color scheme to blue
Add a photo placeholder in the about section
```

### 5. Deploy

When you're happy, click "Deploy" to get a live URL.

**Congratulations.** You just built a website.

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### ❌ Being too vague

```
Bad: "Build me a website"
Good: "Build me a portfolio website with hero, about, projects, and contact sections"
```

### ❌ Asking for too much at once

```
Bad: "Build me a full e-commerce site with payments, inventory, shipping..."
Good: "Build me a product listing page with 6 items and an add-to-cart button"
```

### ❌ Not iterating

Don't expect perfection on the first try. Ask for changes:
- "Make the text bigger"
- "Change the button color to green"
- "Add more spacing between sections"

## Security Basics

Even as a beginner, remember these:

1. **Don't share API keys publicly.** If a tool gives you a key, keep it private.
2. **Use strong passwords.** For any accounts you create.
3. **Be careful with forms.** Don't collect sensitive data without understanding how it's stored.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable:

1. **Try a more complex project** - Dashboard, Chrome extension
2. **Learn basic HTML/CSS** - Helps you understand what AI generates
3. **Move to Cursor** - More control, more power
